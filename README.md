SQL Burger is a demonstration of the model-view-controller design pattern. The app uses MySQL for the database, Express.js for the server framework, Handlebars for HTML templating and Bootstrap for front-end design. Users can add burgers to a list that they'd like to try. Once added to the database, the burgers can be marked as "eaten" and moved to a separate column. Users can then delete burgers from the database.
